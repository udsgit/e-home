## **General info**

**Date**: December, 2019.  
**Duration**: 1 Week.

This project was created in order to use the vast majority of **Bootstrap 4** components, for this reason it is overloaded with them 🤪. To have a certain functionality, a little of **JS** and **JQuery** have been added along with a list of 20 fictional houses to be able to use the filters. Additionally, the rest of the information on the page is fictitious.
